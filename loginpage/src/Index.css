/*   Explanation
 useState
    Think of it like a small "memory box" to remember what the user typed.
    username and password are stored here.

 useNavigate
    This is used to move (navigate) to another page in your website.
   
  handleLogin function
    This runs when you click the login button.
    It checks if the username and password are correct.

  preventDefault()
     Normally, when you submit a form in HTML, the page refreshes/reloads. 
     But in React, we don’t want the page to reload.
     So we use e.preventDefault() → it stops the page from refreshing.
     This way, your React code (login checking) can work smoothly.
